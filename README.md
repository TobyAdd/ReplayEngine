## Important Note
ReplayEngine is currently in beta development, and half of the features may not be available compared to DashReplay   
To make Internal Recorder work, you need to download and place [ffmpeg.exe](https://github.com/AnimMouse/ffmpeg-autobuild) file into Geometry Dash folder  
To make clickbot work, you need to download and place [clicks.exe](https://github.com/TobyAdd/clicks/releases/latest/download/clicks.exe) file into Geometry Dash folder

## About
ReplayEngine is a redesigned and improved project that offers more accurate macro recording and a more flexible interface than DashReplay.

## Installation
Firstly, you need to download DLL [here](https://github.com/TobyAdd/ReplayEngine/releases).

Then, you need to inject a DLL into Geometry Dash.

There are quite a few methods for this:

- MegaHack v6+: place DLL to `extensions` in Geometry Dash folder.
- GDHM: place DLL to `GDHM/dll` in Geometry Dash folder.

- no mod menu:

  - ProxyDLLLoader:
    - download [XInput9\_1\_0.dll](https://github.com/adafcaefc/ProxyDllLoader/releases/download/v1.0/xinput9_1_0.dll), and put it in GD folder;
    - create `adaf-dll` folder in GD folder, and put RE DLL into it;
    - done.

  - quickloader:
    - download [quickldr](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837026406282035300/859008315413626920/quickldr-v1.1.zip), and extract zip to GD folder, replacing `libcurl.dll`;
    - create `quickldr` folder in GD folder;
    - create `settings.txt` file in new `quickldr` folder, and add to it RE DLL name (e.g. `ReplayEngine.dll`);
    - move RE DLL to `quickldr` folder;
    - done.
