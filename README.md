# How to install
You need to inject a DLL into Geometry Dash. You can use [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/index.php) or [another injector](https://www.google.com/search?q=dll+injector). Do not inject it with Mega Hack as it may not work properly. You can use [GDDLLLoader](https://github.com/adafcaefc/GDDllLoader) to inject it
